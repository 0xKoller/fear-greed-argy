# Argentina üêÇ o üêª (Bull or Bear)

## Project Overview

Live version: [https://datita.0xkoller.me/](https://datita.0xkoller.me/)

## Features

- Real-time economic indicators including:
  - Monthly Inflation
  - Year-over-year Inflation
  - Country Risk
  - 30-day Deposit Rate
  - Blue Dollar Rate
  - Official Dollar Rate
  - Exchange Rate Gap
- Custom "Bull or Bear" index calculated from various economic factors
- Dark mode support
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Index Calculation

The Bull/Bear index is based on several key economic indicators, each with a specific weight:

- Country Risk (20%)
- Year-over-year Inflation (20%)
- Monthly Inflation (15%)
- 30-day Fixed Term Deposit Rate (15%)
- Previous Month's 30-day Fixed Term Deposit Rate (15%)
- Exchange Rate Gap (Blue Dollar vs. Official) (15%)

Data is obtained from official and reliable sources, including INDEC, BCRA, and financial data provider APIs. If data is not updated, the latest available data is used. Each indicator is normalized on a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst historical situation and 100 the best. The weights are then applied to calculate the final index, which ranges from 0 (extremely bearish) to 100 (extremely bullish).
